Very interesting project 
    https://github.com/felixchenfy/Detect-Object-and-6D-Pose
        [1. Scann object's 3D model](https://github.com/felixchenfy/3D-Scanner-by-Baxter)
        [2. Collect data for training Yolo](https://github.com/felixchenfy/Mask-Objects-from-RGBD)
        [3. Train Yolo](https://github.com/felixchenfy/Data-Augment-and-Train-Yolo)
        [4. Locate object 6D pose] TODO 

-> all those respository are forked.

-> what we can do to improve the above project

- [ ] use yak to make better model
- [ ] replace Baster robot by UR5
- [ ] Apply next best view planner
- [ ] 6D pose estimation 
- [ ] 2d for tracking, 3d for pose estimation
- [ ] gripper
