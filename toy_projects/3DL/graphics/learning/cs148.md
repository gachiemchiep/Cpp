• Electromagnetic Spectrum – how light works
• Sensors – how light is measured
• Trichromatic Theory – exploiting humans limited perception of light wavelengths
• Dynamic Range – light intensity
• Tone Mapping – lossy compression of light intensity
• Color Spaces – choosing the best trichromatic basis for the
application
• Printers…
• Displays

Loop subdivision surface : increase number of vertices by subdivision, invented in 1986, very famous algorithm 

There are many modeling programs that are designed to help you create and modify models
    • Blender (free)
    • Autodesk Maya (free for students)
    • Autodesk 3DSMax (free for students)
    • SketchUp (free)
    • Meshlab (free)
    • Other modeling programs include Modo, AutoCAD, Lightwave, Bryce, Hexagon, etc.
    • Many 3D modeling programs also include other features such as animation and simulation.
• Model Database
    • Aim@Shape (models used in graphics academies, e.g., Stanford bunny, dragon, armadillo, etc)
    • Archive3D (everyday objects, e.g., desks, chairs, sofa, etc)
    • GrabCAD (mechanical objects, e.g., robots, planes, cars, warships, etc)
    • TF3DM (well categorized free models)
    • TurboSquid (largest model database in the world, but only part of them are free)
    • 3DWarehouse (architecture, e.g. buildings, bridges, furniture, etc.)
• Procedural Modeling
    • Libnoise (a C++ library to generate coherent noise)
    • Noise Texture Generator (generate your noise texture online)
